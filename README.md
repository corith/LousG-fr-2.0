# LousG-fr-2.0
Round two of 3-13 command line Implementation :)


## How to run

1. git clone https://github.com/corith/LousG-fr-2.0.git
2. cd into LousG-fr-2.0/src
3. run `javac LousReady.java && java LousReady`


## Testing scripts

- There are several testing scripts that can be used to run and remove .class files as well as test the Hand.java class functionality.
- in order for the scripts to work you will need to make a "class" directory (mkdir class) inside of LousG-fr-2.0/

- These are all python scripts and for now are simply contained within the src directory
    - these will probably be moved to their own directory as more are created
