Things To Implement/Fix

    - recognize an "out" hand
	- this is a hand where every card is part of some set of 3 or more cards

    - potentially work PlayWizard into checking for winning hand?
        - or add a referee class? 

    - make a computer turn (probably make the best move possible to start?)

    - improve interface
        - 1) potentially display cards better
        - 2) accept KQJA or 11\12\13\1

    - work on scoring the hand
        - still need to implement a decision system
            - currently it prioritizes ofAKinds over runs

    - probably do a complete overhaul of AssDriver.java
        - clean it up as well AND set it up for more functionality

    - look into the dynamic of AssDriver and PlayWizard
        - I like the idea of PlayWizard but it only has one function right now and I am not sure
            it belongs in that class.
        - but this class may have a good purpose for other stuff


Refactor
    - looking to refactor the players hand so that instead of playerOne.hand.deadwood.cards[i] it will be
	playerOne.hand.cards[i]

    - userTakeTurn()
        - maybe put theOption has player attribute like getPlayerChoice(return this.playersChoice;)
        - maybe put topCard as an attribute of DeckOfCards ??
