Things To Implement/Fix

    - recognize an "out" hand
	- this is a hand where every card is part of some set of 3 or more cards

    - potentially work PlayWizard into checking for winning hand?
        - or add a referee class? 

    - make a computer turn (probably make the best move possible to start?)

    - improve interface
        - 1) a better discard interface
        - 2) potentially display cards better

    - add checking for discard card 
        - as is, user can discard any number card they want as long as suit is viable
        - issue with negative input as well - it does not prompt again, just waits for pos num
    

    - work on scoring the hand
       	- right now it adds the wild card to point total
        - still need to implement a decision system
            - is this card more useful in a run or a meld
        - the findTheMelds function might find runs instead of melds.


    - for some reason there is two tallyscore methods, one in Hand.java and one in Player.java
        and they both appear to do the exact same thing.


    - probably do a complete overhaul of AssDriver.java
        - clean it up as well AND set it up for more functionality


    - look into the dynamic of AssDriver and PlayWizard
        - I like the idea of PlayWizard but it only has one function right now and I am not sure
            it belongs in that class.
        - but this class may have a good purpose for other stuff
