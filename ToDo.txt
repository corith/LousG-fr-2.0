Thing To Implement
    - recognize an "out" hand
    - make a computer turn (probably make the best move possible to start?)
    - improve interface
        - 1) a better discard interface
        - 2) potentially display cards better
    - potentially work playwizard into checking for winning hand?
        - or add a referee class? 
    - add checking for discard card 
        - as is, user can discard any number card they want as long as suit is viable
        - issue with negative input as well - it does not prompt again, just waits for pos num
